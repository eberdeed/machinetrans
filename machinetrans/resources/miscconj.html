<P>This GUI across the top has the line editors for the short
form past passive participle, which you can edit to suit your needs.
Note that if the verb has no past passive participle, there will
be no short form and the editors will be empty.  The stem of the 
short form is editable and typing "ENTER" after the edit will propagate
the change throught the line editors.  The short form English is also
editable.</P>
<P>For the verbal adverbs and the imperatives you do not have
to have values present.  The program will automatically adjust for 
absent entries.  Once again the English and Russian forms are editable.
When this page is accepted the SQL review page is shown and any
last minute corrections can be made then.  Be careful not to break
the SQL code or you will have to do the whole thing over.</P>
