<P>The verb conjugation page allows you to review or edit the current verb's conjugation.
You can adjust the verb's spelling both in Russian and English.  Note that you are allowed to
browse amonge the verb pages, there are four of them.  Each time you open a page the 
values for that page are calculated and stored so that you can come back to  them.  This 
creates a situation where if you have completed more than one page and return to this
one and adjust the verb's spelling or turn off the English "oneself" option for a reflexive
verb, the data will not be the same on the other pages.  This has been solved by the
"Recalculate" button that will delete the stored data so it is recalculated as you go
through the pages again.</P>
<P>The verb case is the case required by the verb's object.  To edit the conjugation either edit 
each value in the line editors below or change the stem and press "ENTER" to change all
the line editors at once.  To adjust the endings you can press the "Conjugations" button below
and select one.  The endings for the conjugation selected will be displayed on the page.
To edit the English use the line editors above and to cancel the process press "Cancel."</P>
