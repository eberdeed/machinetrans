<P>This is the data entry interface for adjectival declensions.  
In the center of the screen, in yellow, is the declension the 
system has picked for your adjective, it may or may not be
correct.  Below, across the bottom, are a three buttons:
A Reject button to stop and go back to the previous screen.  
A Declension button to go to the adjectival declension GUI
and pick another declension. And Accept to accept the current
declension and go to the SQL check screen.</P>
<P>Across the center of the screen are the various values for
a given declension: (Masculine) Animate, (Masculine) Inanimate, 
Feminine, Nueter, Plural Animate and Plural Inanimate. To enter 
a custom declension, select the radio button for the given type 
of declension and then change the value for the given declension 
in the line editor for the particular case.  To change the stem 
type a new stem in and then press &lt;ENTER&gt; which will 
propagate the change throughout  the declensions.  At any time 
you can cancel what you are doing, and if something is accepted 
with an error, you can edit it from the "Data" button on the main GUI.
The next page is the short adjectives page for this adjective, you can
jump back and forth between these two pages and they will remember
your edits.</P>
