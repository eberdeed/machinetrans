<center><h2>Data Editor</h2></center>
<P>The recommended way of using the data editor is when you have
12 or fewer lines of data to edit.  If it gets larger than this you should
go to the data display screen and use SHIFT-Click to select a group
of entries and delete them and try again.  And if your 12 or fewer lines 
are all of the same word, delete all the entries for that word and start over.  
The reason I recommend this is because the data entry GUIs provided
guide and correct the process in a way the raw data does not.
The main text screen in the middle is editable and will update to the 
database when the GUI is exited. For info on SQL consult the documentation
provided with your version of PostgreSQL, usually in the directory "/usr/share/doc".</P>
