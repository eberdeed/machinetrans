<P>This is the Noun declension selection screen.  Here you select declensions for
masculine, feminine, nueter and plural, animate and inanimate, and you do this 
once for singular and once for plural.  The gender of the noun is changed by
the declension you select.  You choose the gender and number from the
drop down up on top and then select the conjugation for that class by clicking
on the list.  Once again cancel will cancel this screen and accept will accept it.</P>
