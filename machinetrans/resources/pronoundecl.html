<P>The pronoun GUI allows you to edit a single pronoun
or a pronoun group.  It starts out in single pronoun mode
with the pronoun for "I" listed.  You can select other 
pronouns by pressing the "Pronouns" button at the 
bottom, which opens on the pronoun list. 
In the pronoun list you can select a single pronoun or 
add all the pronouns in the list at once by pressing
the "Add All" button.  See the help files for this page
for more information. You can also edit a new pronoun
by adding a stem and then selecting and ending from
the endings page.  You can change the stem of the pronoun
and reset all the values by pressing "ENTER" with the cursor
in the stem line editor.  If it isn't exactly what you wanted, 
edit the individual line editors and press accept.  Don't
forget to add an English value.</P>
