<P>Here you can edit the declensions of a short adjective.
To edit the adjective either change each item in the line editors
above or change the stem below and type "ENTER" that will
update all the declensions above. And, of course, you are allowed
to edit the English value.  The back button will return you to the main adjective
entry page.  All edits made to this page and the previous page 
will be remembered by the system.  Accepting the page will give you a 
listing of the SQL commands for these two pages and they will be 
entered into the database, unless of course you cancel.  </P>
