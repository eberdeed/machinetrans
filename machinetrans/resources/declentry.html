<P>The screen at the top of this page shows the current declension.  The declension and gender
can be changed by pressing the declensions button.  Russian nouns occur in four genders:  
Masculine, feminine, nueter and plural.  Note here that masculine, feminine and nueter 
nouns all have plurals, but plural only nouns do exist. Across the bottom of the screen 
you will see Reject to stop and go back to the previous screen, Declension to choose 
another declension and Accept to accept the current declension  (once again be sure 
to consult the wiktionary at www.wiktionary.org).  The plural only declension is under 
the masculine singular declension (see below for changing declensions).</P>
<P>The noun stem and  English line editors allow you to adjust the values for these items.  This
becomes particularly important if the system is not selecting the noun stem correctly, you
can edit the noun stem and type "ENTER" and have all the line editors change at once.</P>
<P>The first time you press Accept it will give you a machine calculated plural declension
for your noun, you have the option of pressing Declension and selecting another declension.
The second time you press Accept the program stores the plural forms and ends the dialog, 
this sends you to the SQL check screen where you can check and edit your data one last time before 
it is committed to the database.  At any time you can choose to press Reject and end the process, 
returning to the main screen.</P>
