<center><h2>Data Entry</h2></center>
<P>This is the jumping off point for the entire data entry program.  Here you select
a class of words by clicking on the list and pressing "Accept," after which you 
will be prompted for an English and a Russian value.  At this point for the Russian 
only, enter nominative singular for nouns and infinitives for verbs.  The rest will be 
added later.  If you enter a Russian letter in an English word you will receive an error.  
Likewise if you enter an English letter in a Russian word an error will show.</P>
<P>Once you enter your words you may encounter more options to choose from
or a seperate GUI to enter data in.  If you open another GUI it will also have a 
help button in the upper right-hand corner for help with that page. If you need 
help with the options consult the included overview document or search the internet.  
Most of the options presented are standard grammatical categories. At any time in 
the menus or during entering a word you have the option to cancel and start over.</P>
<P>The data button on the bottom of the screen allows for editing the data 
in the database directly, see the help on that screen for information on how to 
use that GUI. The SQL button allows viewing the current SQL command as the 
system has it, and it can also be edited.  Cancel cancels the ongoing process and
quit ends the program.  When you press quit, the program will go through and check
for duplicate entries and remove any it finds.</P>
