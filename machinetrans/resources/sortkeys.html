<center><h2>Sorting Keys</h2></center>
<P>The sorting keys page presents you with a series of drop down.
Each drop down represents a category of data represented in the 
previous data page.  When you select the category of data from the
first drop down it becomes the first "sorting key" so that category
is sorted alphabetically first.  When you select a category from the
second drop down that category is sorted after the first category and 
so on for as many categories as there are.  When you press reset the
sorting keys are cleared and you can try again.  When you press
quit the system automatically sorts on the English word and then on
the Russian word as the second key.  When you press accept all 
the keys you selected are sorted in the order given and displayed on
the data page.</P>
