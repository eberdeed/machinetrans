<P>Invariant words are words that are not conjugated or declined in Russian.
The GUI allows for entry of multiple new values and editing of existing values.
To delete an item press the "Delete" button.  To enter a new value just write 
it into the line editors, then press the "Add" button.  To edit an item click on the 
list and the item will be displayed in the line editors below.  Edit it and press 
the "Add" button. This page unlike so many other pages does not allow for 
an SQL check page, edits to the database are done as the editing occurs.</P>
