<P>This is the adjective declension selection screen.  Here you select declensions for
masculine, feminine, nueter and plural, animate and inanimate, and you do this 
all at once.  You can cycle through the different declensions using the up and down
buttons to the right of the display screen.  The declension showing is the one that 
will be displayed on the adjective declension page that calls this screen.  Once 
again cancel will cancel this screen and accept will accept it.</P>
