<center><h2>Past Tense Verb</h2></center>
<P>The past tense verb is conjugated only for gender. To change
the conjugation you can either change the stem and type "ENTER"
and the change will be propagated among all the conjugations, or
change each conjugation individually. The english values have much
the same process with the English past tense verb being editable
and typing "ENTER" while the cursor is in the line editor changing
all the individual English values.</P>
